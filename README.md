# PS_express_node
#### Library application using NodeJS and Express.

All code was initially written while following through the Pluralsight.com course "[Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0 (UPDATE)](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/jonathan-mills)" by [Johnathan Mills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanfmills). 

The application that was provided by this course was built into its current form by applying lessons learned in other Pluralsight courses:

* [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents) by [Cory House](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coryhouse/).
* [Bootstrap 4 for the Developer](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/bootstrap-4-developer/table-of-contents) by [Mario Duilio Macari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariomacari/).
